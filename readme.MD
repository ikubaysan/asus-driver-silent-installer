ASUS thankfully puts all their drivers in uniform installers, for this laptop at least:

https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/vivobook/vivobook-16x-m1603-amd-ryzen-5000-series/helpdesk_download?model2Name=Vivobook-16X-M1603-AMD-Ryzen-5000-series


and I needed to install these drivers on multiple laptops, so I made this script.

Put this script in the same folder as your driver installers, and run it. It will prompt for elevated permissions at start, if necessary.
